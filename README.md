# QA Automation Scripts
Welcome to my automation testing project! This repository contains scripts built with **Selenium**, **Selenide**, **Java**, **Gradle**, and **JUnit** to test website functionality, like field validation and info checks.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Automate pop out windows for couple of Daxtra web-site tabs
- **Tools**: 
  - Selenium & Selenide for browser automation.
  - Java as the programming language.
  - Gradle for build management.
  - JUnit for test assertions.
  - IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE.
    
## How It Works
These scripts:
- Validate the presence of the tabs on the main page.
- Make sure that first two  tabs has the list of products.
- The products has the hyperlinks and it works ok.
- Run in a browser via Selenium WebDriver.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qa-automation-scripts.git`
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Ensure Java and Gradle are installed. I have used Java: v. 17.0.12 and Gradle 7.4
4. Run a test on MainPageTest.java
